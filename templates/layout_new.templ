package templates

// This file is a temporary scaffold while refactoring layout/navigation.
// The authoritative layout + navigation currently remain in layout.templ.
// Once the new structure is finalized and verified, we will:
// - Move Layout + UserInfo + Navigation components into this file (layouts)
// - Keep page content in templates/*.templ or templates/pages/
// - Keep shared UI in templates/components/
//
// For now, this file is intentionally empty to avoid duplicate symbol errors.
