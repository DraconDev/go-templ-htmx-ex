1.  **Architecture:** Always think architecturally. Proactively create new files for distinct responsibilities and place them in a logical folder structure.
2.  **File Size:** Ideal: < 100 lines. Absolute Max: 200 lines.
3.  **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):** Aggressively separate concerns. Extract logic into distinct modules for:
    *   Business Logic & State Management
    *   Data Access & API Services
    *   Utility & Helper Functions
    *   UI / Presentation Components
    *   Configuration & Constants
    *   Data Models & Type Definitions
